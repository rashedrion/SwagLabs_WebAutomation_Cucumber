# Cucumber with TestNG Test Automation Project

Welcome to the Cucumber with TestNG Test Automation Project! This project demonstrates how to leverage the power of Cucumber and TestNG to create powerful and maintainable automated tests.

## Overview

This project showcases the synergy between two popular frameworks: Cucumber and TestNG. By combining the behavior-driven development (BDD) capabilities of Cucumber with the flexibility and parallel execution capabilities of TestNG, we've created a robust and efficient test automation solution.

## Features

## Technology used

- 🥒 Cucumber BDD: Write test scenarios using the natural language Gherkin syntax, making your tests more readable and accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

- 🏭 Parallel Execution: Leverage TestNG's parallel execution capabilities to run tests in parallel, maximizing test coverage and reducing execution time.

- 📊 Detailed Reporting: Generate comprehensive test reports with TestNG that provide insights into test results, failures, and performance.

- 📦 Modular Design: Organize your tests into reusable step definitions and feature files, promoting maintainability and reducing duplication.

- 🛠 Customizable: Tailor the framework to your project's specific needs by easily extending or modifying the existing test logic.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository to your local machine.

```

```

- import this project as a maven project in your favorite IDE

- Run the sample tests provided in the project to familiarize yourself with the framework and its capabilities.

## Usage

Define your feature files using Gherkin syntax in the `src/test/java/features` directory.

Implement the corresponding step definitions in the `src/test/java/step_definitions` package.
